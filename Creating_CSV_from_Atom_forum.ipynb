            "after downloading atom on to my mac i cannot open atom. i get an error message atom cant be opened because apple cannot check it for malicious software.. same here. perhaps a new issue  i am on mbp early 2015 macos catalina 10.15.1.. if youve copied it to the applications folder then you can rightclick it and select open. one of the choices in the dialog will be to launch the application. when you do that youre whitelisting it to be run in spite of the inability to check it.. same issue as well.. this worked for me thank you leedohm. . another way to solve this problem is to go to system preferences then go to security and privacy then go to general there should be a message saying some thing like atom cannot be opened because its not from an identified developer. next to that message there should be a button that says open anyway. click on it to open atom.. do you know why this occurs.  has something changed in the application the introduces a risk or is this more due to the upgrade to catalina. this is a change in how catalina treats applications by creating a new requirement for notarization essentially requiring developers to register their applications with apple even if they dont put the application in the mac app store.. this work perfectly thank you . thank you. it worked like a charm gracias. thanks this worked for me . another solution is to remove the quarantine extended file attribute from the atom.app application folder and its contentsdrag the app to applications folderopen a command prompt terminalcd applicationssudo xattr r d com.apple.quarantine atom.app. this worked. thank you. securitywise this sounds like a terrible idea. atom 1.46 beta is already notarized so the openfromcontextmenu workaround should suffice.. thanks i hope to sign up to honor you . thanks. \n",
            "as written in the title its impossible for me to search themes and packages.if i try to open the page of one of the featured packages it get stuck on loading xxx. some here. no proxy or vpn although i tried a vpn just in case access to atom.io works just fine in my browsers no other apps have connection issues. installing any of the featured packages works too as does updating packages. what doesnt work is searching for any packages or themes to install that just says stays on . the situation is still the same i did some tests using apm to install packagesthemes works fine and if a package has some dependencies i can easily install them within atom so this is could be a temporary solution for anyone having the same problem.tried to fresh install everything but same result also tweaking with some atom settings does nothing. it would be helpful to know if there are any errors in the developer tools console. no errors just a warning but i dont know if its related. same for me as well. i dont know if its related to the problem but im running atom on manjaro 19.0.2 gnome.. i have the same issue also on manjaro but the apm command still works.. mhh im on manjaro too this could be a hint . another manjaro user chiming in saying this is also an issue for me. arch  manjaro  im seeing a theme.. same problem here manjaro and i cant search for packages.i have voted on alerques bug report to get attention to the issue.. same issue voting right now.. on kde manjaro 19.0.2 i had the same problem searching packages and themes in atom 1.44.01 community and 1.45.0 snap. this is how i solved it. the latest update fixed the issue it was related to 1.44 as far as i know. \n",
            "dear teami get the following error message upon trying to install platformio ide terminal. the same thing happened to me today. i opened atom and all of a sudden the package was gone and when i tried to reinstall it gave me this exact error. somebody else suggested downgrading the package and atom to 2.8.4 and 1.3.3.1 respectively and i managed to do that for the package but not for atom. this was such a great package before it completely crashed. it was a good package. its a shame i cant get any other terminal to work either either wont install on 1.39 or they are unresponsive with a blinking cursor so i had to go to c9. same for me. i found sort of a solution. if you go to the github repositories for earlier versions of atom you can download version 1.38.2then if go to your command prompt on windows you can type in apm install platformioideterminal2.8.4 to install the older version of platformioideterminal. the two are now compatible. it works for me running windows 10 64bit. make sure that you uncheck automatic updates in settings so that this doesnt happen again and wipe any existing copies of atom off your computer before downloading 1.38.2. hope this helps. this works  you must intall both atom and the ide old versions. thank you thank you.i used this zip  httpswww.npackd.orgpatom1.38.2and thes instructionssolved  cannot find module ..buildreleasepty.node . i use atom 1.39.0 and installed platformioideterminal 2.8.4 and it still breaks.if i start a new terminal  sign on the bottom line of the editor then it pops up and does nothing.i havent verified it but downgrading atom to 1.38.2 may be the solution.are there any hints to get atom1.39.0 and  platformioideterminal2.8.4 or even platformioideterminal2.9.1 running. im having this same problem. installed 2.8.4 but the terminal doesnt show anything. same thing happened to me. while working with atom yesterday evening serial montor suddenly  stopped working. tried to install the platformio ide terminal but got errors like the ts.now i have uninstalled atom and are now wating for installation to complete but it takes forverer. waiting for atom dependenciesi have a new i7 computer and a 200mbit internet connectionlooking at my cpu it seems to be repeating the same thing over and over. and no its not any other programscreen shot 072619 at 06.03 pm.png767326 37 kb. i dont know whats happening with your installation but you dont need to uninstall atom to troubleshoot things thats kind of a drastic step. if you want to try a different version just download the .zip file from the github releases page and drop the folder anywhere on your computer. then youll have a clean nonupdating version of atom that you can run and have access to all of your packages.. thank you. i downloadedan an older version disconnected internet installed disabled automatic updates reconnected internet and now its working.. this is working for me thanks. i created a .zip of the working ide and old atom version. github wont take files over 25m and its 116m. im happy to send people copies or a dropbox link. let me know if theres osme webspace i can leave it for everyone.. i believe having a dropbox link would be a better way to do it.. \n",

i need this program for school. thanks for replies. i also want solution of the problem.thanks for replies. greetings i need the solution for this problem too. thanks for the replies. if youre having trouble with the installer give this a try.  attempting to suggest a possible cause. is there no actual fix to this with the installer is this just with latest version. it may be worth enquiring from users what the size is of the download file was. a checksum sha256  md5   of the install file may be of value.. is there no actual fix to this with the installer is this just with latest version. windows 8 yeah just seems to be this current version. 1.39 installs from a zip and works.. is that 32bit or 64bit jimjams. oh 64bit. jimjams sorry one more question  can you share your squirrelsetup.log file so we can see any installation errors  the file should be located in appdatalocalatom  if you have any trouble pasting it you can share it as a gist httpsgist.github.com. hi sorry just having trouble finding that. so i went into appdata  local  atom but i dont see squirrelsetup.log. atom.jpg746463 26.6 kb. i have had exactly the same problem with the latest version.  windows 8 64 bit.. to use the atomx64windows.zip or atomwindows.zip file from the releases page . extract i. this is my solution. i experienced this problem when installing atom on versions of windows lower than windows 10. to fix this problem this is the only legit workaround i have discovered so far. 2nd option worked for me.thank you so much.. \n",
            "sometimes when im writing source code ill write something like schedule at the end of a line then tap enter.  atom changes schedule to something else like foobarschedule123  some name of something i wrote six days ago but do not want right here in source code.   if i can train myself to always tap a space after a word then atom does not mess with it.. disable the autocompleteplus package. alternatively set the key binding to whatever you prefer i personally use tab.. aha i didnt know about that package.  disabling the whole thing stops the autoruination.  i see an option automatically confirm single suggestion that maybe is the real trouble maker but turning that off didnt make the problem go away.. i see theres a bug concerning this.  httpsgithub.comatomautocompleteplusissues645. i agree that autocompleteplus tends to get in the way. its a bit better when you select tab always enter when suggestion explicitly selected under keymap for confirming a suggestion in the settings but the problem is that if there is only one suggestion there is no way to explicitly select it using the keyboard. see also httpsgithub.comatomautocompleteplusissues943. personally ive never run into this problem. ive got my trigger character set to tab and it always does as i would expect. from the original issue description it sounds like nothing is wrong they just dont want the enter key to expand an autocomplete because they wanted a newline but the package cant read their mind.. aerijo we dont expect the package to read our mind.. something i really dont like about the atom community is that perfectly reasonable well motivated requests are brushed off as if they were very strange very special personal quirks. well sorry for the rant im a bit frustrated because i think atom is brilliant in many ways but also feels kind of abandoned by its devs.. we want autocomplete not to insert some random completion into the text upon the use of keys that are regularly used in the normal editing of text.. fixing the issue with allowing a single suggestion to be selected would take a pr. dont insert a completion immediately but only if the user has selected it explicitly. there is no best way the best way is to have user preferences to control this kind of behaviour.. \n",

            "after the acquisition of microsoft is atom dead. there are still commits but the lack of activity on the blog the termination of project xray no atomrelated news at github universe and the general lack of new features except git maybe it all makes me doubt theres much of a future to be honest.. i also have the same feeling that the project is slowly dying. interesting. i just started a course and they coach is using atom. now i heard from a lot of people i should not use atom but vscode now i really dont know why is there something bad with atom i actually like this editor.. microneticatom in hibernation again or an inch from being cancelledidleberg already said what there is to say.. i really like atom and i will continue to use it tried vscode but didnt like it and i 100 will finish the course . atom is as alive or dead only in as much as it has market share and contributors. there was already discussion on this very topic last year when microsoft originally acquired github and of assumption by extension atom.. as much as it has market share and contributors.. you quoted me about market share and contributors.  theres a saying that you cant flog a dead horse. in the world of software and code if something isnt being used by anybody or contributed to then it is technically dead and hence depreciated. graphics drivers for isa graphics cards being something that springs to mind.. shefstealth your reply steers the conversation into another direction.. the implication of all of these is atom dying threads is that development progress has dried up or stalled since microsofts acquisition of github and these threads in and of themselves seem to advertise or market to the wider world that atom is in trouble which in turn means that potential users might not even bother giving the project a chance if they believe that it is becoming eol.. what idleberg stated 22 days ago is what the public sees.i may even include observations to see on the various github projects . in the world of software and code if something isnt being used by anybody or contributed to then it is technically dead. core issues like dataloss or installation issues have been around for years and a substantial amount of people still complain about them i never had these troubles myself.. atom is as alive or dead only in as much as it has market share and contributors. there was already discussion on this very topic last year when microsoft originally acquired github and of assumption by extension atom.. i agree with pretty much all of that. ive been forcing myself to use vscode over the last few weeks. ive managed to get equivalents for most of the packages i use in atom but i still dont like the visual style and ui restrictions.. oh well maybe facebook ditching nuclide and atomideui is an indirect consequence of githubs acquisition by microsoft. in general typically a project continues but may fork. the original project may still always continue. as an example think about the history of openoffice.org and the reincarnations that this project has had over time. first oracle then sun microsystems then apachedocument foundation. the most significant being when libreoffice forked from what is now apache openoffice. yes projects may stall but ultimately continue. code can flourish in the wild given the right conditions or become depreciated when the world moves forward. software licencing can help or hinder a transition process.. the reason is why. \n",

            "today in the morning i was coding with terminal called platformio but suddenly it stopped working and said it needed rebuild i uninstalled it and installed again and the installation failed. then i tried to install term3 and termination and the same happened installation failed. i dont know what to do and it seems strange because everything was working just fine some hours ago i have to finish a project and i am panicking. any clueshere is the error when installing platformio. your atom version was updated.. this thread is identical to another one you posted recently. please limit yourself to one thread per question.. i installed the normal version on atoms website. this exact same thing just happened to me im using the normal stable channel as well and i can tell it updated and now i cant use any of my old packages i tried reinstalling atom but it just wont let me install any packages. wont let me install any packages. oh youre right its not every package just most of the ones i used. hey for the gyp error it looks like you dont have python binaries. im pretty sure you need those in order to do what your doing. i assume your using a rebuild can you tell me what device your on e.g. mac windows linux.. i can give an answer since i have exactly the same problem.. a hopefully temporary fix. note if you follow my above procedure please go to help  about atom and uncheck the automatically download updates checkbox or else you will be back in the same position soon. i too am having the same exact problem with a different terminal package.  i tried several other terminal packages and got the same error each time.  as suggested by apengelly i went back to v 1.38.2 x64 and it seems to be working again.. the upgrade from 1.38 to 1.39 came with an upgrade of electron from 2 to 3. this makes native modules written in c no longer compatible.. unfortunately apengelly i do not think you can stop atom from updating and going back to version 1.39.      ive unchecked that option but atom installs it anyway on the next reload   how are you keeping it from going to 1.39  a quick google search tells me that others are having my same problem.. i had this happen.  i cant guarantee that this is the reason why mine is not updating but i did clear my downloads folder of the 1.39 download and only kept the 1.38 x64 download in the downloads folder.  since then it has not tried to update.  fingers crossed.. unfortunately in the last hour atom has completely stopped working on my windows 10 machine unless i run it in safe mode.  i love atom but frankly ive had more trouble with it over the years than any other editor ive used.  im trying really hard not to bail on it  . downloading the .zip and running from there will 100 protect you from autoupdate behavior. does atom function when you do that. the problem persists.  i will limit advisories.  newuser as of today is it just me or do you folks need a case of jolt cola and several pizzas. the package authors are the ones who need pizzas. the version upgrade inside atom isnt going to change and its only a breaking change in cases where a native binary is prebuilt many packages that are designed with windows in mind because windows is frequently configured without python and the compiler tools that all linux and mac machines have by default.. as a neophyte i erred.   how should the packagers be addressed. \n",
            "i made a packageatompdfjsviewerthemed fully featured pdf viewer for the atom editor. it does basically the same thing as pdfviewer and pdfviewerplus but it is better than both. . unfair your package description says some features such as synctex  have not been implemented yet  so i thought i could skimp on that too. alright coming up. . and i cant actually get it to work with your package.. ive got it in an init script but the service exposing clicks etc in terms of pdf coordinates is available. in my opinion the pdf viewer should be generic but open to customisation through this service. so synctex shouldnt be built in because not all pdfs are for tex but a provider can be registered to handle them when appropriate. i just havent polished the script and how im going to provide this provider. i recommend the same approach and would like to work with you to get a standardised api. part of the point of the service is so that users can swap out pdf viewers easily and that means they all need respect the same service.. ok there is a new version that supports synctex reverse lookup bound to rightclick.it probably needs some polishing but for me it already works well.just like for the whole thing id be interested in any testing results.. but more importantly the pdf.js developers explicitly request it . allefeld ive documented the service here. i hope we can develop a useful api.. i had a look here are some comments so far. and a few minor comments. so i would either propose to add that to the list or let the consumer decide which events they want to listen to.. and finally shouldnt we include izuzak in this discussion. ill preface this with conceptually it should be possible for an external pdf viewer to implement this protocol. there is no need for the provider to be a pdf.js iframe.. ok updated the spec with the suggestions and added some additional tweaks. i avoided using onuserselected as a name as that implies a text selection. ive started naming the versions in the revision history so changes can be compared. i wont make an actual changelog until its stable.. thanks for updating. further comments. ps ive seen that izuzak has made his last post here in 2014 and was last seen last may. we should contact him via an issue on his pdfview repository.. keeping synctex in mind as the application for a pdfgenerating package it doesnt really make sense to keep track of all open  newly opened pdfs. re pdf locations. the provider has to provide a way to directly open a pdf specifically it has to do so by registering an opener for file paths ending in .pdf. agreed i wasnt sure about the change anyway.. \n",

            ". its a very bad error message because it doesnt provide context. are there any details in the developer tools console. nothing at all in the developer tools console. thats one of the reasons why i cant figure it out. . is this in windows linux or mac. ah i forgot to mention that. its the latest version of windows 10. ill do some investigation regarding the link you provided. ill give an update later.. alrightit seems that base linter cannot find the python on my computer. atomrunner was working just working so do base linter. it make no sense. only one explanation is that python directional folder is on an external hdd. i simply dont want to take up much of space on my os and thats why i put the folder of python on different hdd.. yelp. it is unusual to span two drives with as i understand python scripts in atom in drive a and python in drive b. but something like this might help. explore links. and why not try installing and running atom in drive b and launch it from drive a that is atom and python in same drive particularly if you are short of space in drive a os.. yeah i already have atom on drive b same as python. the issue is that atom is showing error message where it cannot find python via path. but i ran atomrunner and use linter there are no issues. i dont know if this is a bug or not.  i also launch the shortcut icon of atom from desktop drive a.. it is true that the link i posted refers to the opposite of what you want. but it was to give some ideas to build on.you have not expanded on how much space you do have in drive ai often run applications spanning different partitions and drives. in fact i use a triple boot configuration windows 10  ubuntu 18.04   backup across two drives one hdd the other ssd.. hmmm. ill have to consider that. a dual boot system i have heard about it. there are some people who use linus and windows 10 for dual boot systems. some use mac and windows 10. i dont know there was another system called ubuntu 18.x. interesting.. but right now i dont have enough money to get a new hdd. interesting i dont know theres a place that have old stuff for computer. . \n",

            "i have a site that i am now editing with atom.. that should only happen in a markdown file where underscore means italics unless a package youve installed is applying it to other files too. what is the extension of this file. the extension of the file is .md which im assuming is a markdown file. its a new format for me as ive just started experimenting with using grav as a cms.. is there no way for me to turn this off. however when i include an image with this naming format in an tag in atom. the  is a part of an image file name. if i put in a  to escape it it does turn off the purple italic formatting but then the image can not be found when the page is displayed.. using  as part of image names is a in house naming convention for keeping files organized that has in use since before starting using atom and we are not going to go back and rename all our files and change our procedures in order to conform to atom.. screenshot 20191005 17.59.41.png2107239 44.4 kb. that looks like html not markdown. the file should probably have a .html extension instead.. there are html parts of the file but it is not exclusively html. grav uses some markdown but some of the file is pulled in from other sources.. atom is about as configurable as can be but the extent to which you can change it has varying difficulty. in this case there is no fine grained configuration of what the grammar picks up. you would need to find a grammar that understands your markdown flavour or is stricter about the italic rule like languagemarkdown or fork and change the languagegfm package.. what i understand from what your saying is that it is technically possible to configure atom to ignore the underscores but that its so complicated to set up that i wont realistically be able to do it.. editing the grammar would probably put off most people. but you should first try languagemarkdown because it is stricter about when it applies italics and probably wont match the ones in your file names.. thank you for the suggestion but i dont want to take one a whole scripting language or whatever languagemarkdown is just to make a small configuration.. its just an alternative markdown syntax highlighting package. no setup required besides installing it can do this on the command line or through the install tab in atom settings. it will probably make a popup saying to disable languagegfm which is the default markdown syntax highlighter and you should do so.. aerijo thank you for persisting through my skepticism and letting me know it was just a matter of installing a certain package.. im unfamiliar with the norms of this discussion board. is there no way to mark this thread as solved or mark the accepted answer or anything like that doesnt seem to be. what i apprehend from what your saying is that its miles technically feasible to configure atom to disregard the underscores however that its so complex to installation that i receivedt realistically be able to do it.. i want to also thank aerijo for this i looked up how to get rid of purple text in atom markdown and this was extremely simple like the author of the post was looking forbravo. \n",

            "perhaps im misinformed but it appears that discuss is being used as the primary platform for support requests for atom. while i have no problems with discuss as a forum technology i think it lacks the necessary features to handle support requests.. would your view change if it was stated that this forum is for users helping usersthe serious stuff would probably best be handled on the project pagehttpsgithub.comatomatomissues. snoop ah yes that makes a lot more sense. and yes my view has changed. thanks for enlightening me. vertagonsoftworks i may be wrong but it is my impression that atom like many older editors is no longer being supported at all. ive evaluated around 12 editors so far and all have bugs reported years ago that havent been fixed yet. this is standard there is initial excitement and lots of development and bug fixing then the developers wander off to other things. in my search i think ive ended up with ultraedit not completely sure yet. atom has some great ideas in it such as being implemented in electron as an htmlbased app with easy css extensibility except for figuring out how the lengthy descriptor lists work but unlike emacs it cant really be extended easily by the user to add new features. just my impression having worked with it for just a few days. i could be wrong in any of these opinions.. easy css extensibility except for figuring out how the lengthy descriptor lists work but unlike emacs it cant really be extended easily by the user to add new features. aerijo thank you for your corrections. i didnt see any examples of extending atom using javascript or html in its documentation but im glad to hear that it can be done just as easily as with css. as for emacs it is based on an implementation of the lisp programming language. it is possible to extend emacs using the same lisp functions and commands that emacs itself uses for its features. unlike atom emacs documents how to do this in complete detail. emacs is not only one of the longestlived editors it is also one of the bestsupported. however it does have some drawbacks including a big learning hurdle for newcomers. for the documentation there is an api reference in the flight manual and it also includes a chapter dedicated to writing packages. it can take some getting used to for what each api component is for but it is a generally good and complete reference.. \n",

            "i have an application that plays ogg audios with html5 audio api. im facing performance issues when running this program in very slow and old computers with windows os. im trying to fork a new process in electron and play the audios with a module or a node addon. but im not finding a module or a node addon to do this. is there any module or node addon to play ogg files and work with electron. when you say html5 audio api do you mean the audio tag or the web audio api  the most important question is where is the performance bottleneck coming from on these oldslow computers and im not sure that playing the audio on an additional thread would help because the bottleneck is likely in decoding the ogg compression while playing in realtime and taxing an old cpu with a new process might hurt more than help. i recommend trying to decompress the audio data first in its entirety before playing and see if that helps. you can do that with the web audio api using decodeaudiodata or if you wanted to use a separate process and avoid decompressing the entire sound to ram you could do that with a shell exec call to a command line utility like sox or ffmpeg to convert the ogg to a temp uncompressed wav.. im using the web audio api to play the audios. would be better if i was using the audio tag ill follow your recommendation to decompress the audio before playing and ill check if it helps. to you understand better the problem is like the audio is cutting out when playing. now the audio is playing in the renderer process right im using angularjs to do many other things so i think that this process is overloaded. so i thought to separate that part of the application to avoid suffer processing concurrent with the rest of the application. the ideia is use the concept of chrome by separating each tab in a different and isolate process. it makes sensethis problem does not happen on midhigh performance pcs only in oldslow pcs like old single core processors.thanks for your answer.. electron already supports the chrome concept of many processes making for light work but the api is only designed for two ways of making a new process spawn a childprocess or create a new browserwindow. you want to do the latter to create a player window that you can spawn with the path to an audio file and have it play you can do this right from your renderer process. this has the additional benefit of protecting your app from crashes involving the most interactive part of your program since if anything goes critical in the player window short of a raging memory leak it should only block that window.. i dont think it would be better to use audio because with the web audio api you have much more flexibility. so if youre already using the web audio api i assume youre playing your ogg file using an audio buffer which likely means your code is already calling decodeaudiodata on the buffer before starting to play it. i would try tweaking the web audio latency settings and see if that helps. start with setting your audio contexts latencyhint to playback if youre getting audio break up on slower machines. another thing you could try tweaking is lowering the contexts sampling frequency when you instantiate the context for example it usually defaults to 48khz you could lower it to 22khz if you dont care as much about quality to lower overhead. anyway if youre really targeting old single core machines 10 yrs old spawning another process likely wouldnt help because the cpu couldnt handle multiple threads anyway.. i converted all audios to wav and started playing this format but i didnt saw any improvement. that way im not sure if the problem is in compression. the evidence i have is that an older version of this same player in vb6 plays audios without much trouble on these computers but in this new electron version the audios come out with playback bottlenecks. it is as like the audio were stopping milliseconds while playing. i know that the vb6 version is native to windows and will work better in this situation but it was in this sense that i had the idea of making the c  addon to play the audio to try to have the same performance. do you know any techniques that i can debug my application to find where is the central point of this problemmany thanks. the audio stuttering you are describing sounds like a buffer underrun. it may just be that the overhead of all of the components of electron and the assumptions made by chromiums audio engine plus whatever ui overhead your app may incur are too much for the old hardware to be able to handle. did you try tweaking latencyhint can you post some of your code on these old computers are you able to run chrome and use a simple example audio playback page like httpswebaudioapi.comsamplesvolume. \n",

            "im suffering with this error for a while now if i try to remove the indexeddb on .configatom... it works but after one to four reloads of atom it stops working again.. what is the issue and what is the code mre and no the title of this thread is not sufficient to debug anything.. what is the issue and what is the code. ok what i meant is that i had this error on console. i asked if there was a better way to debug this issue maybe a guide or something i searched on the atom issue tracker saw that it was posted multiple times once was closed automatically so i wanted to see if i could find better answers on this discuss.. can you send me an example. i suspect what youre running into is a permissions problem. perhaps this occurs after you launch atom in an elevated administrator context thereby making the indexeddb database only accessible by root. after that the only option is to delete the database files completely and start over.. i dont think thats the issue im not using sudo or even working with any other user. sometimes it happens when i open atom on a project and a subfolder of that project.. okay it happened again today. no reloads just opened a new editor in a new folder and it straight up gave that error on console not saving editor state anymore. i can somewhat reproduce it if i open more than 4 editors for different projects  the last one will not be able to connect to indexeddb . \n",

            "cannot install platformio ide terminal 2.9.1 on atom, dear teami get the following error message upon trying to install platformio ide terminal. the same thing happened to me today. i opened atom and all of a sudden the package was gone and when i tried to reinstall it gave me this exact error. somebody else suggested downgrading the package and atom to 2.8.4 and 1.3.3.1 respectively and i managed to do that for the package but not for atom. this was such a great package before it completely crashed. it was a good package. its a shame i cant get any other terminal to work either either wont install on 1.39 or they are unresponsive with a blinking cursor so i had to go to c9. same for me. i found sort of a solution. if you go to the github repositories for earlier versions of atom you can download version 1.38.2then if go to your command prompt on windows you can type in apm install platformioideterminal2.8.4 to install the older version of platformioideterminal. the two are now compatible. it works for me running windows 10 64bit. make sure that you uncheck automatic updates in settings so that this doesnt happen again and wipe any existing copies of atom off your computer before downloading 1.38.2. hope this helps. this works  you must intall both atom and the ide old versions. thank you thank you.i used this zip  httpswww.npackd.orgpatom1.38.2and thes instructionssolved  cannot find module ..buildreleasepty.node . i use atom 1.39.0 and installed platformioideterminal 2.8.4 and it still breaks.if i start a new terminal  sign on the bottom line of the editor then it pops up and does nothing.i havent verified it but downgrading atom to 1.38.2 may be the solution.are there any hints to get atom1.39.0 and  platformioideterminal2.8.4 or even platformioideterminal2.9.1 running. im having this same problem. installed 2.8.4 but the terminal doesnt show anything. same thing happened to me. while working with atom yesterday evening serial montor suddenly  stopped working. tried to install the platformio ide terminal but got errors like the ts.now i have uninstalled atom and are now wating for installation to complete but it takes forverer. waiting for atom dependenciesi have a new i7 computer and a 200mbit internet connectionlooking at my cpu it seems to be repeating the same thing over and over. and no its not any other programscreen shot 072619 at 06.03 pm.png767326 37 kb. i dont know whats happening with your installation but you dont need to uninstall atom to troubleshoot things thats kind of a drastic step. if you want to try a different version just download the .zip file from the github releases page and drop the folder anywhere on your computer. then youll have a clean nonupdating version of atom that you can run and have access to all of your packages.. thank you. i downloadedan an older version disconnected internet installed disabled automatic updates reconnected internet and now its working.. this is working for me thanks. i created a .zip of the working ide and old atom version. github wont take files over 25m and its 116m. im happy to send people copies or a dropbox link. let me know if theres osme webspace i can leave it for everyone.. i believe having a dropbox link would be a better way to do it.. , none\n",

            "opinion discuss is not a good platform for support requests, perhaps im misinformed but it appears that discuss is being used as the primary platform for support requests for atom. while i have no problems with discuss as a forum technology i think it lacks the necessary features to handle support requests.. would your view change if it was stated that this forum is for users helping usersthe serious stuff would probably best be handled on the project pagehttpsgithub.comatomatomissues. snoop ah yes that makes a lot more sense. and yes my view has changed. thanks for enlightening me. vertagonsoftworks i may be wrong but it is my impression that atom like many older editors is no longer being supported at all. ive evaluated around 12 editors so far and all have bugs reported years ago that havent been fixed yet. this is standard there is initial excitement and lots of development and bug fixing then the developers wander off to other things. in my search i think ive ended up with ultraedit not completely sure yet. atom has some great ideas in it such as being implemented in electron as an htmlbased app with easy css extensibility except for figuring out how the lengthy descriptor lists work but unlike emacs it cant really be extended easily by the user to add new features. just my impression having worked with it for just a few days. i could be wrong in any of these opinions.. easy css extensibility except for figuring out how the lengthy descriptor lists work but unlike emacs it cant really be extended easily by the user to add new features. aerijo thank you for your corrections. i didnt see any examples of extending atom using javascript or html in its documentation but im glad to hear that it can be done just as easily as with css. as for emacs it is based on an implementation of the lisp programming language. it is possible to extend emacs using the same lisp functions and commands that emacs itself uses for its features. unlike atom emacs documents how to do this in complete detail. emacs is not only one of the longestlived editors it is also one of the bestsupported. however it does have some drawbacks including a big learning hurdle for newcomers. for the documentation there is an api reference in the flight manual and it also includes a chapter dedicated to writing packages. it can take some getting used to for what each api component is for but it is a generally good and complete reference.. , meta\n",
